                    <p>As the global population grows, the well-being of modern human societies continues to be
                        dependent on available natural resources. Many regions are facing and attempting to mitigate the
                        impacts of increasingly frequent and damaging climatic events including heat waves, extended
                        droughts, storms, or changes in rainfall distribution and intensity. An enhanced understanding
                        of fundamental processes should be used to discern best practices, guidelines, regulations, or
                        policy briefs that are the basis of mitigation and/or adaptation measures. However, there are
                        notable knowledge gaps in research with those issues magnified in underrepresented regions</p>
                    <p>Scientists set out to summarize the development of Research Infrastructure (RI) over the last
                        three decades in Southern Africa and take it a step further by assessing how the successful
                        maintenance and further implementation of RIs may turn them into important anchor points for the
                        positioning and long-term development of environmental scientific work in support of
                        environmental sustainability, national commitments, and societal well-being. The study also
                        outlines the importance of understanding the impact on the environment, science, and society
                        that a fully functional RI is able to cause and provides an example of potential key indicators
                        using the Integrated Carbon Observation System as a model:

                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As large amounts of data are required across a broad range of intersecting disciplines to
                        effectively address emerging global challenges, the impact of this study can provide the
                        framework for the use of RIs to mitigate the impact on environmental health. </p>
