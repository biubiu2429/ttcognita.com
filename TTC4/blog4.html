                    <p>Future Earth Taipei held its 2024 Annual Symposium to showcase the transdisciplinary research
                        accomplishments of its local research working groups. More than 90 people from industry, public
                        sectors, and the 11 Future Earth Taipei Working Groups (FE-TPE WGs) participated in the event at
                        Academia Sinica in Taipei on January 19th. Covering various topics such as risk, health, ocean,
                        urban issues, and the digital age, these FE-TPE WGs aim to connect local research networks with
                        Future Earth's global sustainability research communities through collaborative activities.</p>
                    <p>To offer attendees a comprehensive understanding of Future Earth's origins, Future Earth Taipei
                        invited Dr. Yuan-Tseh Lee, the former president of Academia Sinica and a Nobel Laureate, who is
                        notably recognized as the founding figure of Future Earth Taipei, to deliver a keynote address.
                        Professor Lee emphasized Future Earth's core missions: Generating knowledge accessible to all to
                        address environmental risks and promoting actions toward global sustainability. The FE-TPE WGs
                        remain committed to providing platforms for developing solution-oriented research to drive
                        societal transformations in response to pressing environmental challenges</p>
                    <p>The symposium consisted of four forums covering topics such as Risk & Resilience, Nature-based
                        Solutions & Health Adaptation, and Local & Global early career researcher engagement. Local
                        researchers presented their recent findings and addressed key issues within their respective
                        fields. For instance, during the Nature-based Solutions & Health Adaptation Forum, presenters
                        discussed the effectiveness of increasing urban green areas in alignment with IUCN (The
                        International Union for Conservation of Nature) Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions. They
                        also showcased environmentally-friendly approaches to vector control management.</p>
                    <p>Future Earth Taipei Hub also partnered with the Future Earth Sweden Hub to promote the 10 New
                        Insights in Climate Science and collaborated with the FE-TPE WGs to prepare for an upcoming
                        regional event in the next quarter.</p>
                    <p>Stay tuned for Future Earth Taipei's upcoming events!</p>
